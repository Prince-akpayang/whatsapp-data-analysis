## Introduction



## Loading required data and packages

The following packages will be loaded for this study in case needed.


```{r packages}
library(data.table) # to manipulate tables
library(tidyverse)  # to manipulate tables and its large dictionary of other manipulation packages including string variables
library(ggplot2)    # to manipulate plots (grammar of graphics)
library(lubridate)  # to manipulate dates
# library(tidytext)
# library(stopwords)
# library(tidymodels)
# library(syuzhet)
# library(RColorBrewer)
# library(dplyr)
# library(stringr)
# library(igraph)
# library(tm)
# require(wordcloud)
```

## Read the data

Due to the size of the data being about 1GB and my hardward not having the give ability to process this data set smoothly, we will only load the last 3 months of the data that is December, January and February files.

```{r reading the data}
# Specify the path to the folder where the CSV files are located
folder_path <- "~/CODE/ANALYSIS/capstone google/last_3"

# Get the file names of CSV files in the folder
file_names <- list.files(path = folder_path, pattern = ".csv", full.names = TRUE)

# Create an empty list to store the data frames
data_list <- list()

# Read each CSV file and store the data frames in the list
for (file_name in file_names) {
  data <- fread(file_name)
  data_list[[file_name]] <- data
}

# Access the data frames from the list
# For example, to access the data from the first CSV file
first_data <- data_list[[1]]
second_data <- data_list[[2]]
third_data <- data_list[[3]]
```

### Merge the data set

Having loaded the data files we access its structures to see if they have the same column names (its expected to though)

And then join all three together into one data frame.

```{r merge dataset}
colnames(first_data)==colnames(second_data)
colnames(first_data)==colnames(third_data)
colnames(second_data)==colnames(third_data)

# Since all the columns are equal we merge the data as one

cyl_df <- rbind(first_data,second_data,third_data)
glimpse(cyl_df)
```
### Data cleaning

Having gotten the data frame for the study, a glimpse at the structure reveals some key highlights that need attention.

- We would love the time of the ride given in the **started at/ended** at to be split into **day, date** and **time** as independent columns.

- we would like the to edit some headings like the **member_casual** to be renamed to make it meaningful as **membership_type** and  **rideable_type** to just **ride_type**.

- we would like to change the structures of **rideable_type** and **member_casual** to factors not characters.

- we would also remove unnecessary white-spaces/characters if any.

```{r column renaming}
colnames(cyl_df)

# renaming to test
colnames(cyl_df) <- c("ride_id","ride_type","started_at","ended_at","start_station_name", "start_station_id","end_station_name","end_station_id","start_lat","start_lng","end_lat",        "end_lng","membership_type")
```


```{r day_date_time}
cyl_df <- cyl_df %>% 
  mutate(ride_day = wday(cyl_df$started_at, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE),
         ridedate_started = as.Date(cyl_df$started_at),
         ridedate_ended = as.Date(cyl_df$started_at),
         ridetime_started = as.ITime(as.POSIXct(cyl_df$started_at)),
         ridetime_ended = as.ITime(as.POSIXct(cyl_df$ended_at))) %>%
  select(-c("started_at","ended_at"))
  glimpse(cyl_df)

```
